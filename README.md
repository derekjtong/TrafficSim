# TrafficSim

TrafficSim is a Rust-based simulation for modeling traffic flow and road item interactions, including dynamic entities like vehicles and static entities like traffic lights.

## Features

- Simulate various types of road items: `StaticRoadItem` (e.g., traffic lights, stop signs) and `DynamicRoadItem` (e.g., cars, trucks).
- Customize vehicle behavior with adjustable parameters for speed, acceleration, and direction.
- Support for dynamic interactions between vehicles and traffic control mechanisms.
